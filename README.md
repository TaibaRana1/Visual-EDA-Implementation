# Visual-EDA-Implementation
This project focuses on applying Visual Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights from real-world datasets. The assignment emphasizes storytelling and question answering through effective visualizations while adhering to core visualization principles.

The project uses two real-world datasets:
    1. Airbnb Listings Dataset
    2. FIFA Football World Cup Matches Dataset (1930–2014)
The goal is to explore patterns, trends, and relationships through effective visualizations while critically evaluating graphical integrity and design principles.

🎯 Objectives
   1. Perform comprehensive visual EDA on both datasets to uncover insights and formulate hypotheses supported by visual evidence.
   2. Analyze and compute the Data-Ink Ratio for selected visualizations and critique them based on established visualization principles.
   3. Construct a graph and network diagram representing all matches from the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
